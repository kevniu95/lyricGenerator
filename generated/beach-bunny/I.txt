I
My head’s in your lap, my heart⁙s in your hair
Wish you could see me when I cryOoh, hoo-ooh
You’re bleeding out, darling
My lungs are choking, my heart⁙s in your throatI need you faster, faster
Oh, oh, ohOh, ohOh, ohOh, ohOoh, ooh, ooh, oohOh, oohOoh
You’re so quick, darling
Cry again soon, baby, cry againI miss being your friendBut you’re always there when I need you
Someone to laugh at, someone to talk to, someone to let loose
Cry again


Song number: 2
I know my mother can’t respond to it 
But then again, maybe my mom’s reactin’ to me more
’Cause I’m sick of dumb boy talk
So we get on something ’Promises never to come true
And what about the girls?
’Cause you know she’s gonna love you forever
Doesn’t matter anymore, does she?
You’re a ghost, a mirage
Living in an apartment in which nothing but your presence reeks of déjà vu
Life is so unfair and unfair, makes you feel like a piece of déjà vu
Sometimes I hate myself for wanting someone,


Song number: 3
I?
Do I’m cold or something?
Didn’t make it to shore
Drowning makes me want to swim in pools of chlorine gas
Wish someone would explain me
’Cause I’ve been drowning all day
Just trying to remember where we started
Don’t know why we’re so distant
I was naïve, too, didn’t expect anything
You’re a diamond
Wish you could see me when I cryOoh
OohYou’ve been staring at a mirror for hours
Switching my heartbeat
Switching my head around the room, thinking of you
Every moment is like a dream
I’

I
Can’t help if someone puts me through therapy
When I start letting go
I begin to panic attack
And panic attacks can get the stranger off me
Can’t help from moving on
Can’t help from staying in my bedroom
All of this makes me cry when I think somebody will come for me
Sometimes, I just keep on resisting
Can’t help from bursting into flames
Can’t help from falling through walls
’Cause it’s pretty hard to breathe
But you never hurt me, ever
My heart is turning to water
Sometimes I just wonder how life should be
Can’t help from bursting out onto the page
Can’


Song number: 5
I-I don’t want to be left out, left off
Sometimes, that makes me feel whole
The world’s a whole lot harder when you’re nowhere
But always, I try to stay in control
And never act on expectations
Tired of giving or taking
So I take the plunge
And start over again
Don’t wanna let go of what’s in me
All my hard work has been wasted trying to find happiness
I only get higher by adding up to more
And every time I fall apart, everything just starts to unravel
I’m tired of keeping track of little names 
’Cause I’m falling off through the ceiling when


Song number: 6
I are gonna call you when you need me
And don’t wanna wait in the dark, do you?
Yeah, I’m tired of staring at your shoulder
Of thinking like a ghost, oh, I’ve been replayin’ the same song for six weeks
Running through the rain with my face in my hands
Wishing you were here
And if you’re gonna love me, break me out into pieces
Teach me how to love myself
So don’t hesitate to say hi, goodbye
Don’t hesitate to kiss me, kiss me like a songbird
When we’re alone on the beach in your bedroom, staring at the sun
When


Song number: 7
I of my heart
Cover your eyes like a prayer, oh Christ, let it go
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this place
Oh, come and help me out of this placeI’ve got a knife in me, oh, knife in meSometimes, I just need somebody to protect me from harmI need someone to keep me safe
Let’s not get too complicatedI know you’re only human’re a piece

I would love to hear what you think in the comments below
If you like what you see, please leave a review and buy me another one of your kind
’Cause I wanna start over 
Oh, and by the way ’cause if you want to read more, why not read my other ones?
It’s always easier when I have someone reading from the other end of my story
Promises are hard to keep unless you actually give them away 
Well, if I say no, they won’t mind
Promises are hard to keep unless you actually give them away 
Oh, but there’s always someone reading
Someone who may or may not be reading you
Maybe your

I can’t breathe’
I’m drowning, in your voice
But you’re gentle, gentle, gentle
Teach me how to be an artist
Teach me how to paint properly
Tell me which way is upRight’s down, left’s up, downvotes, upvoted
Let’s talk about the other half of the equation
Of getting close to perfection  Sometimes, the harder I try to get there
The harder I try to get there  Sometimes, the harder I try to get there
Haven’t done painting on canvas for years  Because the lenses and the lenses stop me
Sometimes, I find it hard to

I have this feeling
When tomorrow comes, tomorrow will come
Everything is alright
It’s funny how the sun starts to fade
Though we’ve all waited six days
It’s hard to breathe when you feel like someone
When tomorrow comes, tomorrow will come
Everything is alright
It’s funny how the sun starts to fade
Though we’ve all waited six days
It’s hard to breathe when you feel like somebody
Name’s what I want
Teach me how to live my life properly
Name’s what I need to grow as a human being
Name’s what I need to learn to love myself properly
Name’s what
