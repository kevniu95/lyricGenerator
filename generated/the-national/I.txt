I'm not the only one who thought of it.
You need to find someone who loves you
If you look like me
It's okay to be somebody else
And the only ones who can come close
Are the ones who tell me
You know I love you
You know you can’t feel my fear, it’s not a serious thing
When I want to be free, I ask you
What do you want?
Where do you wish you were?
Where do you feel comfortable?
What do you want?
Do you really wanna make the world a little more beautiful?
I’m all alone and confused
I’m all alone
But you’re right


Song number: 2
I is a liar and I'm an asshole
Why are you still there, isn't that the truth?
Why are you still here?
And I guess what makes you think so much about me
You know the man is getting better each month
What does he want?
The good feeling you get
From your wife in the pool
To the new house
You have nothing to lose but your heart
What makes you think so much about me
Why are you still here, isn't that the truth?
Don’t blame yourself for it
For me
Because I didn’t ask, didn’t make my choice
When I was young, I thought I was lost
When I am young


Song number: 3
I is looking at you a lot
And I see yourself in your place every night
If I don't do something, then I will be sorry
You won't be there for me in a while
You won't be here for me, I swear
It won't be easy
It won't be easy
If it was easy for you, then it would be easy
It wouldn't be easy
But if you ever wanted to come
Come out to the park
And see how you all look
I believe there is another way
If you ever wanted to stay here
Just come out there and get me help
Wherever you are, I will protect you
That is one way
Just say no
And say


Song number: 4
I.T.L., not the way you want it to be
Just think I said I'd love my life
You don’t know when to stop
You don’t know when to come for me
Your mother always reminds me
It isn’t a mistake
That just shows up in the weather
Can’t get rid of it
It’s pretty bad
Does it make me think?
’I do it often
I wonder if my sister is home somewhere
I’m trying not to think about this
And I need to be better
’Cause I don’t know what to think
And I need to be better
Is it easy to

I think we're out for dinner anyway."
We walked, I didn't say a word, the only person in the room was Mr. Jones.
And I won’t leave my husband behind me, I won’t leave my house
He looked pretty, I think we were pretty alright until I saw him, after we kissed, and I couldn’t shake the feeling
I was afraid of someone, scared of me
We’ll have a party here
For our friends, don’t go all the way around them
But let it be your call, okay?
Don’t you think, let your kids run off to the side, where they would be more familiar
I


Song number: 6
I
I wanna see you
Now that I know you well
That I guess I can go out and drink and be with you a little more
And then we could come to a peace
Let it be
What about the light blue and light blue light
In your brain? That's one thing
When you were a child
But now you're gone
What do you think of you? What do you feel like about yourself?
Like you know, I love everyone
You would think everything through the way you thought
And wonder if every little thing matters
That way you wouldn't get so carried away with things that were never there
That way you wouldn't get the attention that you didn’t really need



Song number: 7
I
Well, look, if only we could have said it better
Cause I’m in love
You know me better than anybody
I know you better than anyone
You gotta try a lot harder to explain it’s what it is
Hey, get out of my way now, don’t follow me
All right, all right
I am gonna try something different
I see you on TV the whole time
I’ll see you like any other girl
The lights are always off
And the world seems quiet
It’s a pretty good time to be living outside
We never really made it home yet
How long should we stay?
It’s hard sometimes, even


Song number: 8
I: I don’t feel that way
’Cause my whole heart keeps changing
You can't tell me you love me
I never ever thought I wanted to talk like this
But I get a little tired
Sometimes I just think I’m just lonely
I feel less and less of my own mind and less and less
When I come back I find myself in another room
And there is silence that takes me back again
I’m still feeling lonely
I always think I am alone but it’s not me
You’re inside me now
Are you okay?
Are you okay? I’m afraid of you
But I don’t know if I can


Song number: 9
I can find you if you need me?"
I can feel yourself on fire, but in a way I never could
I swear I could see you on TV for hours
You said everything you thought it wouldn't say
It was okay to get away with what you were doing
’Cause you’re a man now
I didn’t care if I saw this morning ’But when you had your shower and got off the couch, you couldn’t leave it behind, either
Your body doesn’t think of that for too long
Nothing will drive a car home but there you are
You’re gonna have one baby
It never did change how you thought you were going
You


Song number: 10
I can't believe it anymore
And I wonder how much I hate you
When I hear that my heart's on fire
I feel like nothing will be right for awhile, and I don’t want to waste my time
So I try to imagine how it all fell apart together
But it won’t be so easy
Cause everyone was waiting on me to pick me up at a time
For a good girl like you
You didn’t make it to the end without me
Your voice isn’t weak
You wouldn’t be able to stay behind in your shoes
You can’t let it go in any way
Sometimes the little things get in the way
Sometimes the big
