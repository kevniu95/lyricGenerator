I have to live with that, I’m not just saying, okay, look what you did to my family and loved ones this past weekend
And I could’ve said no to anything
And that’s because my heart is not like yours
I love you and your love
It’s nothing but love, it’s everything that’s mine and mine alone
That’s where I’m at all times right now
There are people in my life who say things that aren’t true or wrong
But there isn’t anybody in my life that I don’t want
So please keep the peace
Don’t run from me
I


Song number: 2
I, you’re the one who got me
You were mine
Don’t forget that now I don’t know
You didn’t make it through my roof, you didn’t make it through the rain
So yeah, I think I just saw a million little baby steps
So let’s just get away and pretend
All I have is an empty bottle of wine for my last night
So, um-ay, let’s get away, ah-ay, let’s just get away
Can’t I look like I’m getting bored this time?
That doesn’t sound like fun to me, babe
And I’


Song number: 3
I were just gonna do what I did all night, and now it seems like nothing’s changed
My whole world revolves around you and me 
I’m not your hero, no, I’m not your villain
No, yeah, yeah
Oh!
That was so funny, all those years of watching movies and doing stupid things that I have never made, and you would think I was all about magic
But you were right when I said so
There you are, staring at a bright window
And you are thinking about me, about your baby brother
Oh
You say, Are you really my real mom?
I swear to God she knows I ain’t lying
She’


Song number: 4
I have something else that I want
And I will give you the answer
But just to try and save you in my old age
So I gave you everything I had
Even a kiss from your lips’Cause that’s not a love song
You didn’t do anything bad, you took the bait with me
You made things worse for me, but I promise you what I never planned
So, thank you and I’ll be forever yours again
If you really got through this
And if you ever wanna get on with all of me, yeah, well I guess it’s over
The last thing you needed was us fighting
I gave you everything I had
Even a kiss from


Song number: 5
I have been doing it all along
It’s simple enough and I guess you can blame that
The rest of the world isn’t getting your hopes up
Just when you think I love you
Don’t expect to ever find out what I’ve missed
Even if it’s not too late to get a better chance
And if you’re not up for asking then I’m fine, but I don’t mean to interrupt
So now you are trying to say
I’m getting in some trouble, but I am fine 
In spite of all the help I’ve got, I am not so brave anymore
I just wanna stay in my


Song number: 6
I?’Cause I said,
Let’s go back to the car
You were never your usual self
So when you say, Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Well, you know, a few days ago, you showed your face
And you said,
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
And I’ve been waiting for you and my own baby
When it’s all said and done
We are your people. We have our stories too. We’re both strangers in our own little town
And your baby’s daddy has been missing forever
And I


Song number: 7
I would
But the time goes fast
So watch out
And I ’m begging ’for more
When you’re a monster you’ll never be alone
And all those cruel words
But it’s in your blood
It’s mine to change
You’re one more step closer
Don’t think that when you’re out in the daylight,
You would
But the time goes slow
So watch out
And I ’m begging’for more
When you’re a monster you’ll never be alone
And all those cruel words
But it’s in your blood
It’s mine to change



Song number: 8
I a real believer
And you know it’s bad to not think
You know you’re wrong, oh
But I was wrong!
And you know it’s worse to not get away from it
Oh, oh, oh
But I was wrong!
And you know it’s worse to not lose faith in me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
But I was right!
And you know it’s worse to not look at the way you treat me
Oh, oh, oh
But I was right!
And you know it’s worse to not be afraid to lie
And you know it’s worse to not have people think you're funny


Song number: 9
I that I was so proud of you
Just what a shame it feels to lose you
So don’t you miss me?
Oh, my, yeah
I have a reputation that people don’t get when they see it on a plane
You know, I love you and it’s like I can’t wait to meet you again
I don’t wanna hear anymore stories about your problems
There is one thing that you have to take away that I think she’s been waiting for
And it’s not just the problems. It’s not just the town that needs you right now
’Cause now that I say goodbye, I think we’re


Song number: 10
I can tell you a story
I’ve been away all night
When all of the magic gets on my mind
Tell you why I love you
And when you were dancing around
I know where you were hiding out
And that you never let me feel anything
I know the way you said you loved me before
Don’t ask, Don’t tell
There’s nothing wrong with wanting nothing
But you don’t need everything to love me now
It’s just too late for you
Just one last chance
Don’t leave
Don’t stay
If you could find something in me
Or in yours
With a smile on your face
You
