Song number: 1
I
And my heart is
Drooling on her’s broken heart
It’s still cold inside me
And the way I feel
I can feel the things it feels like to take a life away
A life away just doesn’t make me happy’t mean I want someone who is
Yeah, that’s why it hurt
If you ask me once what this life has been, I don’t think I understand
The deep loneliness I leave around you is making it difficult for me to know
You and I have this one thing
When we both live in hell we only dream of one another
We are different things. It’s easy to let the darkness out



Song number: 2
I
Love this piece of art 
So nice, so sweet
And when I get older
You’re gonna want a little more
Just the two of us
And we’ll hold
That peace that lies between us
When love really starts to show
And I can’t help but notice
All the butterflies and butterflies in my mind
Are you ever gonna notice me?
Are you ever gonna notice my face?
When you see what I’ve learned
All I have to say
Love is just one thing
But the thought I’d put something down to be done
Ain’t gonna hurt your feelings
’Cause I know that nothing hurts me any


Song number: 3
I think I can talk to someone
Just how you look at me
It’s all so hard
Don’t get me wrong, but it’s really hard to talk
So don’t bother with the way we talk
I ain’t trying to sell you anything, just don’t wanna talk about it
No, just don’t wanna talk about it’Cause when I get old, what do I need?
What do I need right now?
Love?
Love? It’s coming out
Oh, and don’t even bother if my hair grows a little
I don’t mind if your hair starts getting thicker
Oh and


Song number: 4
I have nothing to lose but money
I love you
I can take your things and give you whatever I want
I never have anything to lose but money
I love youBut it hurts when the sun rises
And the sky is pink
I ain’t got nothing to lose but money
’Cause sometimes I get lost
My feelings for a long time
There’s a hole that can just fill
And then there’s this river that flows
And sometimes, it’s like a stone falling from heaven
When my bones come together
And my heart says, if you leave
We’ll both lose
’Cause here I am
The same one that I know
Yeah


Song number: 5
I-I’m kinda like an old lady
You know what you’ve gotta do, honey? You gotta be your own queen
And you can’t be anyone else
So don’t blame anybody if you try, honey
But I ain’t ever gonna try to stop you
And if I didn’t try that time last time, I wouldn’t even be here
’Cause you had all the perfect intentions
That never would've mattered
No one else could care less
Because my heart must rest on my shoulders
And I ain’t gonna stop you
I ain’t ever gonna try to stop you
So don’t blame anyone


Song number: 6
I think we don’t have time for that
It’s not the end of the world
We might live a slow but steady life
This is real real
And we still need peace and love in our hearts
For we don’t know what to do
We might live a slow but steady life
This is real realAnd we still need peace and love in our hearts
For we don’t know what to do
Let us leave you without ever leaving me
Let us leave you without ever leaving me
You made me laugh
But I let you out of my sight
Don’t hate me for being who I am
I always love you, and I always will
Keep on


Song number: 7
I, the love of my life!
I can’t believe I finally got to meet you!
Yeah, yeah! How long did it take you to meet me?
A-Aah, we just kind of lost time and fell apart
When you finally finally got to speak with me
You said you didn’t like it when you kissed me
Oh, baby, how I feel, knowing you love me
Baby, your love and me aren’t enough
We need a love like only a love can leave us
And I can’t make up my mind if this is what we need
So now, I’ve given you my last name and your last name
Tell me


Song number: 8
I say, hey, it ain’t just me that ain’t on her mind
She might not know what to do, but she won’t know what to do
Hey, I’m gonna come back. Maybe we should try putting things together
The rain and wind will blow
And you’d never see me again
But why would I ever want nothing more
I hate the idea of you staying here forever
You need something new
And it’s been a long time since we had a drink together
We’ve had this great love
And I can tell that if we’re together and it feels like we got good at it, and it works out



Song number: 9
I.D.'s not gonna go away
I promise ’cause I’m still with you
But we know you can change
And maybe you’ll come back
And talk again, if things don’t turn around
’Cause I know we’ll have to keep it together
We’re gonna fight together
But I’ll be you until the end
Oh, and if I ever get caught in a good ole deal of barmow
It’ll make everything worse
Yeah, right now they’re taking advantage of me like hell
I’ve just got a whole lot to prove
So when’s your honeymoon just over


Song number: 10
I that’s why I love you
Can’t take you down
No, I’m not in love with you
Please can’t do it tonight
Or tomorrow, or next week
And when I’m awake in a hurry, I might as well
’Cause I just love you
Is that why I love you?"
So he starts singing
And what could be the difference?
He’s gotta love him so much
Yeah, it just helps us to do this once
Until the stars come out, then I can only stand there
Laying on the vine
Holdin’ up a little light
To help me shine through the world
A little
