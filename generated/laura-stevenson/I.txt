I-M-G-B-Y-S-W-A
And I hear it on the corner, and I hear it in your ears, and I hear it everywhere you go until I forget that your voice is deafening me
You need to listen up and turn over to watch your heart beating so loud
Cause no sound can tell me what to do
You know how you get so bad at this?
If I had an egg
You'd hatch right now
And your name was out on my watch
You'd make me grow like a big dog
I could see all those kids coming back in the morning
For that I told you
My sister was sick
And I needed you to take her place

I.B.H.D.
Jail Break
Lose Yourself a Lot of Time
A Lot of Time
All Those Years
But You Won't Take Me
And I Can See That I'm Dying
I'm Dying
Like you
Just like I am
With each passing month
Then my eyes become wider
Until I see the sun
And I see the moon
All this dark smoke that's burning in me
And I breathe it down with a little bit of my heart
But you won't take me
Because I can see that I'm dying
And I can see that I'm dying
And I can see that I'm dying
I swear I'm going to die
But I can see


Song number: 3
I are standing on the balcony of an apartment building. I hear a heavy clang and I look at it.
With my finger I start to move from room to room, and while we do it, it takes me many more steps toward building construction
In my mind, there is a burning burning building in the distance
But when I pull up, nothing changes
When I turn right, I'm walking by the bridge
And I am standing on the balcony of an apartment building
With my finger I start to move from room to room, and while we do it, it takes me many more steps toward building construction
In my mind, there is a burning building in the distance
But when I pull up, nothing changes
When

No, your name is too big
It's so sad
And you know it
You do it in your sleep
No more crying for you
Forgive me
Forgive me
Forgive me
I am sorry and sorry for your love
No more crying
Forgive me
Forgive me

I-the-world-from-the-side of your eyes.
I-I can't move, can I? I just can't breathe
I-I can't breathe
I-I can't breathe
I-I can barely breathe
I-I can barely breathe
I-I can barely breathe
You-and-these little things you see inside me,
Can you imagine me from below?
Your eyes flicker, flickering away
But the thought that something terrible and terrible must happen before you ever say a word...
And what does that make you think?
Will you make it worse?
Will you keep saying that something terrible or horrible, until the rest of the world just forgets

I think the key, you know... it's all that I don't take lightly. I am an honest, sincere, honest, honest man, I will stand up and say that this is a lie, and that I'm telling the truth, and that I'm only going to turn my back on any man who gives in and says he won't go through with me, oh, oh, oh. Well, we won't ever be friends again for a long time; I was wrong about that."
The sound came so quickly, like a siren bell at the far end of a long hall, and soon it sounded to the very end of it all.
And then a familiar silence fell upon her before it could even begin,


Song number: 7
I can't believe it, I was wondering what you had been up to all day. I am just saying that it wasn't pleasant. I just couldn't tell the truth.
Lying in bed against my mom's desk, I think back to the things that we have said all day
But when the door slammed shut from inside
I held out hope that you wouldn't mind it
So I told her, 'It's okay, no worry about it, don't worry about it. But this is it, the end of life, and I am here to let it go.' I held my hand out and pulled the door in, waiting for the world to turn a few miles away
And I didn't know what to do

I
Well the reason I am alive is because I said "I will die, I will live".
I say to those that come and stand as I do and I say to them, I want to save them
I'll fight you until I stop
And with the power of my voice you can hear me sing
Please be silent so I am able to make a dent in it
I'll give you a ride, or leave the house, or just sit here and watch my brother lie dead
Because there is nobody left to say goodbye to but me, I am my mother and my sister
So please keep me from hurting someone else, I am doing so for you
So that you wouldn't feel sorry for me like we


Song number: 9
I to be your sister?
We all will remember you
Because that is what we left over
And that is all we want left
Because if we don't get it soon enough
And everything we have
Our bodies wrapped up in our blankets
But we know you still love us
And that we are here to help you with things
And it's okay
Because you keep being nice
And we try not to go on doing our job
We try not to be a bother
And we need to be a nice nuisance
So if you are okay, I will take care of it
For you and maybe for yourself, we'll just have to stay
And it'll be alright though, I assure you
The only

I should not go around wearing my clothes."
You say I was never trying to fool anybody I didn't want to see what happened.
I think that a lot of people don't like me I am pretty good in my eyes, though I am still kinda raw in those eyes.
If you thought it was all right at one time, you wouldn't do it, then no, I want you to be nice to me but nice to everyone around me and so I won't lie about it, I mean you and your sister are going to die before your life as we know it.
Don't go into the dark with your hands in your pockets while we're waiting for you to fall out of our way
We don't know
