I have a long way to go
It’s about fucking with it, I want to make it look like
I just know how to make the fuck up out of shit
My brain just wanted to fuck with me
You see what I mean? You heard it?
I had to do it
I was scared to say no, I guess my mind just wanted to
Fuck with it, I don’t wanna get tied up with this shit
Hurt feelings I was having that haunted me
Fear that it might turn into a nightmare
If I can feel you, then let me help you out
I got plenty money, let me take that back
But not too much, let me keep it in check

I of Krakow’s, fuck this thing
I think you heard me, nigga
You heard me, bitch! That bitch, fuck this thing
Fuck the system, bitch! Let’s get the fuck outta here
If you ever feel like you feel like nothing is holding you back
You feel like that just to keep getting closer
So just take it slow, let it be personal
Let’s start off the album with the new songs.
I started off with this song that I wrote about you and my grandma in elementary.
We grew up with the old world as a kid and now we live where it feels so good to be alive.
And in these songs, I go


Song number: 3
I for the people that don’t die, yeah
Kendrick Lamar for the music that’s good
The people that kill in war, I don’t fight
If I did I would probably do something else
It’s so unfair, it’s so unfair
And I just want to tell everybody to sing along
I ain’t no nigga, I ain’t no rapper, I ain’t no rapper
I’m a rapper, I ain’t no rapper
I ain’t no rapper
I ain’t no nigga, I ain’t no rapper
I ain’t no nigga, I

I’m looking for the biggest hit in my career
With a million million dollars, I never seen that’s something I could sell
So when I was down to just get some sleep I said
If it ain’t broke don’t break it, you should buy a car
It’s about to get ugly
This isn’t some freestyle I do, this is real life
Now tell me where this music come from
Nah, I got a million dollars and I know these city niggas love to beat them niggas
But if I give ’em no help, then let ’em rap me out
Tell me where this music come from

I it was about to happen
What could have been? But my vision faded in the process
It’s been a while, now that I wake up
I’m looking around, I see what’s gonna happen
Don’t you believe it? Just watch this!
This is for you:
This is for you:
Welcome to the REAL LA
You know this is for the OG, the OG, and the OG2
You know this is for the OG, the OG, the OG2
You know this is for the OG, the OG, the OG2
Welcome to the REAL LA
You know this is for the OG, the OG, the OG2

I say, no need for this
I’m here to make a statement that I can share 
No, I’ma’ tell you how much I care
I’m on the verge of being famous
I’m in the city making hundreds of millions 
I’m in California making hundreds of millions 
And if I keep winning big, people start thinking I don’t know
I’m not that person, I’m a realist 
And this is a way for me to show that
That all life can suck a dick
So I am going to do what I gotta to put it where it needs to be
I’m going

I
This is real nigga I’m tryna get this message out to a bunch of hoes that’ll want to be on my side
Like, you wanna win the world then? Then come back and play my drums
Let them take me to the next level, “noutta sight
Let them in the room and say, “you got it now, son, this my home
Look I got it in my blood, so it’s like this, that’s just the way I think when I’m feeling like this
It don’t matter how long you stand before God or go to jail or die for no reason
It don’t matter


Song number: 8
I, I’m so damn high
You never know
That when they say your momma won’t hear it
She want me to stay with you
Now, where the water?

Ain’t no excuse

All I know is this
The way I look at you
You looking at me

Ayy, Ayy, Ayy-ay, let me borrow some shit
Let me borrow somethin’, alright, right?
Uh-huh
Yeah, good-bye, bye, bye, y’all
Yo
Locked up my phone
Y’all been thinking bout this shit
The first time I went out, it looked like you was on the verge of suicide
The next day, I woke up in the morning and I was feeling like an alien
So how can I tell ya my vibe got better?
And, uh, to start off with, I didn’t really say a word
I guess


Song number: 10
I don’t fuck with you
The bitch from the hood I know when this van come round
So that we know when this bitch comes round
And when this van come round
So that we know when this bitch comes roundI think the biggest fuckin’ shit happens in Compton
And the city you in, fuckin’ Compton
You gotta pay your taxes man
And my mother was always worried about the money
And her worries probably drove her mad at times
Like she’s the mother of two
That ain’t funny man
Get it fucked up with me and, y’all are fuckin’ crazy man
Papa is one of my biggest fanboys man
I hope I
